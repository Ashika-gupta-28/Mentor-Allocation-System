# Mentor-Allocation-System
This project- the "Mentor Allocation System" allows mentors to the students based on their choice filling.
Firstly, the professors need to register themselves. They are verified, and the professors need to upload
their area of interest when every profession is done with it, the admin updates, and the number of students
to be allotted under a particular Professor. Now the student asked to register on the website. The students
need to fill out the Choice filling with which professor they want to work. After each student is done with
it, the admin generates the list containing students along with their allotted Mentors. The students and
professor get the confirmation with whom they must work. And the whole process is complete.
